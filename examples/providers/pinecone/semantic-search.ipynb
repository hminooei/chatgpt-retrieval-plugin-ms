   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "1. Install Python 3.10 if not already installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Clone the `retrieval-app` repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone git@github.com:openai/retrieval-app.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Navigate to the app directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd /path/to/retrieval-app\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Install `poetry`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install poetry\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create a new virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "poetry env use python3.10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Install the `retrieval-app` dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "poetry install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Set app environment variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `BEARER_TOKEN`: Secret token used by the app to authorize incoming requests. We will later include this in the request `headers`. The token can be generated however you prefer, such as using [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `OPENAI_API_KEY`: The OpenAI API key used for generating embeddings with the `text-embedding-ada-002` model. [Get an API key here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)!\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Set Pinecone-specific environment variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `DATASTORE`: set to `pinecone`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `PINECONE_API_KEY`: Set to your Pinecone API key. This requires a free Pinecone account and can be [found in the Pinecone console](https://app.pinecone.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`: Set to your Pinecone environment, looks like `us-east1-gcp`, `us-west1-aws`, and can be found next to your API key in the [Pinecone console](https://app.pinecone.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `PINECONE_INDEX`: Set this to your chosen index name. The name you choose is your choice, we just recommend setting it to something descriptive like `\"openai-retrieval-app\"`. *Note that index names are restricted to alphanumeric characters, `\"-\"`, and can contain a maximum of 45 characters.*\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Run the app with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "poetry run start\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If running the app locally you should see something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000\n",
    "INFO:     Application startup complete.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, the app is automatically connected to our index (specified by `PINECONE_INDEX`), if no index with that name existed beforehand, the app creates one for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're ready to move on to populating our index with some data."

The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.\",\n",
